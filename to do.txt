TO DO:

IMPROVEMENTS
- Homogenize the feature detection or the feature detection based on what works better.
- Make the transform finding into a factory pattern


FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
- Tracking and initial map formation
- Local BA

POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFORM FINDING
- Plain ICP
- Plain + Color ICP(Steinbrucker et al)
- Zhang ICP(I suspect this is a deconstructed version of ICP which scales for even just cameras)
- GICP
- GICP6D
