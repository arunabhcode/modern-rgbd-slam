TO DO:

IMPROVEMENTS
- Make the transform finding into a factory pattern


FEATURE IMPLEMENTATION
- Move transforms to local Pose Struct
- Tracking and initial map formation
- Local BA

POSSIBILITIES FOR TRANSFORM FINDING
- Plain + Color ICP(Steinbrucker et al)
- Zhang ICP(I suspect this is a deconstructed version of ICP which scales for even just cameras)
- GICP
- GICP6D

POTENTIAL BUGS/QUESTIONS
- Figure out why unit quaternion rotate pt doesn't work in ICP and quaternion
rotate pt. does.
